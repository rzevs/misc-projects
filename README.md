# misc-projects
Miscellaneous projects I've worked on, posted here to showcase them. As of writing this, I haven't
actually uploaded any of them yet.

## Sims 4 Mod Download Automation
So far only really works with MCCC. Other mods I use tend to be on Patreon, which prohibits crawling.
This script picks up whatever the most recent version of MCCC is from the site, and unpacks it.
If I get back into TS4, I might extend this to cover mods on MTS, too.

## Astronomy Image Downloader
In one of my labs, we had to upload a bunch of astronomical images to a plate-solving website, and
download them after. If I recall correctly, there was no option to mass-download everything. I got
tired of downloading files one by one from the list, so I made a very simple tool that grabbed the
download links for me and downloaded the right images.

## RSR Topology
A puzzle a friend posed me, mostly solved. I did this in a Jupyter notebook.

## Gallery
I went through an inspiration kind of phase and downloaded a whole bunch of cool pictures online to
create some kind of moodboard. I don't have copyright for any of them, so I won't be sharing them.
I used masonry.js to organize them into something that looked nice.
